This repository provides a suite of physics-based simulation tools using Google's deep learning framework **JAX**, featuring both **mass-spring methods** for cloth simulation and **Material Point Method (MPM)** for fluid dynamics. By leveraging JAX's differentiable programming and JIT compilation, these simulations achieve efficiency and flexibility for seamless integration with deep learning frameworks. More examples including ray tracing rendering and inverse estimation will be updated in the future.
