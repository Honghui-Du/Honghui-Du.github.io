## Biography
------
I am a third-year Ph.D. student at the **University of Minnesota-Twin Cities**, working under the supervision of Prof. Qizhi He. My current research focuses on developing **GPU-accelerated** and **differentiable simulation** methods for computational mechanics. I aim to integrate physical simulations with **deep learning** frameworks to enable efficient and **data-driven** solutions for **scientific machine learning** and **inverse design**, with application in physics-based problems (fluid, soft-body, geophysics simulation, and geohazards forecasting).

In addition, I am exploring advanced particle based methods (RKPM, MPM, SPH), with a keen interest in leveraging machine learning for real-time simulations and optimizations. I am particularly passionate about bridging computational mechanics and artificial intelligence to tackle real-world engineering challenges.

Before pursuing my Ph.D., I earned my Master's degree in Engineering Mechanics from Xiamen University in June 2022, where I conducted research on theoratical foundation of particle based numerical methods under the guidance of Prof. Dongdong Wang.
